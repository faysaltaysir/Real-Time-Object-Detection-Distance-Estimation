# Real-Time-Object-Detection-Distance-Estimation
Technologies: Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), ESP32-CAM, IP Webcam, Computer Vision

Implemented real-time object detection using YOLOv8 on video streams from both ESP32-CAM and mobile IP cameras.

Calculated object distance from the cameraâ€™s bottom-center using bounding box centroids and pixel-per-meter scaling.

Rendered live visual feedback with object labels, distance in meters, and directional lines for robotic vision and safety applications.
